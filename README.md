### The implementation of a Product Catalog microservice, developed using modern DevOps practices and cloud native technologies to achieve continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).

### Core Application Technologies
* Node.js with Express: A lightweight JavaScript runtime and web framework that enables rapid development of scalable backend services
* MongoDB Atlas: A fully managed cloud database service that provides flexibility of document-oriented storage ideal for product data
* JSON Web Tokens (JWT): An industry standard method for representing claims securely between two parties (admin and regular user)

### DevOps and Infrastructure Technologies
* Docker: Containerization technology that packages the application and its dependencies for consistent deployment across environments
* GitHub Actions: A CI/CD platform that automates the building, testing, and deployment workflows directly from the GitHub repository
* SonarCloud: A cloud-based code quality and security service that performs static analysis to identify bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells

### Cloud Services (AWS)
* Elastic Container Registry (ECR): A fully managed Docker container registry for storing, managing, and deploying container images
* Elastic Container Service (ECS): A highly scalable container orchestration service that supports Docker containers
* Fargate: A serverless compute engine for containers that eliminates the need to provision and manage servers
* Identity and Access Management (IAM): Fine-grained access control across AWS services and resources
